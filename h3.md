# Time/Space Complexity of MNIST CNN
In the MNIST network, there are two convolutional layers, which are `conv1 = Cov2d(1, 32, 3, 1)` and `conv2 = Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)`. Suppose the size of the dataset is `t` and each image has the size `n * n`.  
- **For `conv1`:** The kernel size is `3 * 3`, so the number of operations in the kernel at each position is $ 3 \times 3 + 3 \times 3 $, as there are $ 3 \times 3 $ multiplications and $ 3 \times 3 $ additions, which is $ 18 $. There are approximately $ n \times n $ positions for each kernel on an image (if $ n $ is large such that the size of the kernel can be neglected), so the number of operations per kernel per image is approximately $ 18n^2 $. Since there are $ 32 $ kernels, the total number of operations is $ 32 \times 18n^2 = 576n^2  = O(n^2) $. As for the space complexity, we need additional $ 32n^2 = O(n^2) $ extra space to store the output. The space for storing the weights is $ 3 \times 3 \times 32 = 288 $.
- **For `conv2`:** Similar to `conv1`, the time complexity is also $ O(n^2) $, and the extra space is $ 64n^2 = O(n^2) $. The space for storing the weights is $ 3 \times 3 \times 64 = 576 $.

Considering the size of the dataset, the total time complexity is $ O(tn^2) $, and the extra space is still $ O(n^2) $ (if the space is allocated sequentially).
